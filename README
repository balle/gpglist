////[ Description ]////

This script should be used in alias files like in sendmail
or postfix and possibly other MTAs to implement GPG encrypted
mailing lists.
It's based on the code of Francisco Jesus Monserrat Coll
http://www.rediris.es/app/pgplist/index.en.html
But it's a complete rewrite from scratch!

Basically it consists of 2 components.
A central configfile (/etc/gpglist.conf per default) which 
contains paths, tempdir, logfile config and such stuff and
the information about list(s) and member(s) and there addresses
and pgp keys.
A directory were the gpg keyring of the list is stored.



////[ Installation ]////

Install the XML::Simple Perl module. You need the development files
of the expat xml parser to do so!
The easiest way to install the module is by executing the following
as root:

perl -MCPAN -eshell
cpan> install XML::Simple

Or point your browser to cpan.org and download and install the module
as described in the modules readme file.

Next copy the gpglist.conf to /etc and edit it.
Create a directory to store list information e.g. /etc/lists.

Now create directory to store the gpg key ring e.g. /etc/lists/test_keys.
Create a new keyring: gpg --homedir /etc/lists/test_keys --gen-key

Export the public key of the list and distribute it to the members
of the list. Remember unencrypted mails will be rejected!
gpg --export -a

Now it's time to import the public keys of your list members:
gpg --homedir /etc/lists/test_keys --import member.key
Don't forget to add this key id to example.list.

Chown all files and directory for the user of your mailing list!
Create the logfile specified in /etc/gpglist.conf and be sure, that the 
user of the mail daemon can write to it.

If you're using Sendmail and using smrsh, than you have to allow
Sendmail to execute your script. On Debian you have to create a symlink
to this script in /etc/mail/smrsh.
strings /path/to/smrsh | grep ^/
This command should show you the link directory.

Last but not least edit your alias file and create the list alias:
test:		"|/path/to/gpglist.pl list"

Now send an email to the list and watch the logfile.



////[ Troubleshooting ]////

Be sure that you really know the user id that will execute the script!
If you want check the uid edit the perl code and print $> to the logfile
(see at the bottom of the script).

Be also absolutely sure that this uid can read and write all necessary files,
that are all created files and directories!

Edit the code and comment out the unlink() calls.
Now you can examine the encrypted and decrypted mail or check the output of 
gnupg depending on where the error occured.
